# Content-Analysis-2020-Final-Project

This is a new corpora for my final project (working with Chu Zhuang), which records social interaction between two people when they are trying to 'debate/discuss' a moral problem in an experiment setting. Two conditions are manipulated in this experiment: 1) one is **Thank you because**: Person A was instructed to respond with gratitude and understanding of Person B's statement before sharing his/her own, for example,--'thank you for sharing your opinion, because I think...'; 2) the other one is **No because**: Person A was instructed to respond with negation and stated her opinion directly, for example, 'No..I think..because'. This study wants to see whether showing gratitude could help people better understand each other's view point and reach an agreement. 

In the content analysis for the final project, we hope to first of all analyze the degree of 'gratitude' in the conversation corpora from linguistic features, by annotation, and examine the degree of 'gratitude' expressed in the corpora in each condition and each pair.
